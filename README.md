[Social Norms Smulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-3djiewnT0-social-norms-simulator) is designed to help users explore and understand how social norms and expectations shape individual behavior in different situations. It offers an interactive experience where users can create or modify scenarios and make decisions based on what would be considered socially acceptable or desirable within a given context. By guiding users through a step-by-step process with multiple-choice options, the tool encourages thoughtful exploration of moral dilemmas, social roles, and cultural customs. It allows users to see how societal rules and norms influence their choices and those of others in everyday life.

This GPT helps users gain deeper insights into the ways that cultural, social, and personal influences affect behavior. Whether exploring ethical dilemmas, social interactions, or role expectations, the simulator creates opportunities for reflection and learning. Through interactive decision-making, users can consider various perspectives, understand different social expectations, and examine how they would act in a range of scenarios shaped by different norms and values. This encourages greater awareness of how societal structures and expectations influence both individual and collective behavior.
